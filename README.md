# dust
This code is based on the work of Favole et al. 2019 and calculates the interstellar dust attenuation coefficient of ELG luminosities in MultiDark-Galaxies (Knebe et al. 2018), whose catalogues are available [Link Text] here (https://projects.ift.uam-csic.es/skies-universes/SUsimulations/MDgalaxies/).

As most star formation occurs in the disc component of these SAM galaxies, that is where the gaseous component is located, we implement dust attenuation only for the disc.
