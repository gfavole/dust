# dust
This code is based on the work of [Favole et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190805626F/abstract) and calculates the interstellar dust attenuation coefficient of ELG luminosities in [MultiDark-Galaxies](https://www.cosmosim.org/cms/documentation/projects/galaxies/).

As most star formation occurs in the disc component of these SAM galaxies, that is where the gaseous component is located, we implement dust attenuation only for the disc.
