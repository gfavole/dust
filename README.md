# dust
This code is based on the work of [Favole et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190805626F/abstract) and calculates the interstellar dust attenuation coefficient of ELG luminosities in MultiDark-Galaxies [Knebe et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474.5206K/abstract), whose catalogues are available [here](https://projects.ift.uam-csic.es/skies-universes/SUsimulations/MDgalaxies/).

As most star formation occurs in the disc component of these SAM galaxies, that is where the gaseous component is located, we implement dust attenuation only for the disc.
